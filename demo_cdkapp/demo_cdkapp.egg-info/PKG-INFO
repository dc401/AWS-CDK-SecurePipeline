Description: 
        # Welcome to your CDK Python project!
        
        This is a CDK built 1.84 Python App
        This project creates a CI/CD pipeline using general best practices and will also auto check the 
        cloud formation synthesized templates for insecure configurations and fail at build time if 
        not corrected.
        
        Run the following to deploy the cdk pipeline and app
        
        ```
        $ python -m venv .venv
        ```
        
        After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
        step to activate your virtualenv.
        
        ```
        $ source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        If you are a Windows Powershell platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:
        
        ```
        . .venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
        ```
        
        Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.
        
        ```
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.
        
        ```
        $ cdk synth
        ```
        
        You can now begin exploring the source code, contained in the hello directory.
        There is also a very trivial test included that can be run like this:
        
        ```
        $ cdk bootstrap --cloudformation-execution-policies arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
        ```
        
        Deploy your app to the AWS account
        
        ```
        $ cdk deploy
        ```
        
        Ensure you have generated your git credentials within IAM and run the following to initialize
        
        ```
        $ git init; git add -A; git commit -m 'initialize'
        ```
        
        Add the origin master git to whichever repo and region you had made (or modified)
        
        ```
        $ git remote add origin https://git-codecommit.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/respos/demo_cicd_pipeline_repo
        ```
        
        
        Set the upstream origin for git to push and enter credentials
        
        ```
        $ git push â€“set-upstream origin masterâ€™
        ```
